# Humans Are The Pollutants
An Analysis of World Development Indicators towards adverse impact to our Environment

## TLDR

## Introduction

### Background

The statement "humans are Earth's top pollutants" has been thrown here and there.  Unfortunately, this is very much true.  All of the factors contributing to the adverse effects in our environment can be very much traced back to some technology that we developed over time to make our lives easier.  Other than making a return to living like in pre-historic times, an equilibrium needs to be reached where we continue to advance our quality of life while ensuring Earth can hold up.

In search of that equilibrium, this analysis will go over through some World Development Indicators over the last few years as well as indicators that drive towards environmental issues (e.g. gas emissions towards climate change).  After going over through these indicators,  observations and insights may be acquired to be acted upon to save Earth while we live our lives better.
