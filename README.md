# Humans Are The Pollutants
An Analysis of World Development Indicators towards adverse impact to our Environment

## TLDR

## Introduction

### Background

The statement "humans are Earth's top pollutants" has been thrown here and there.  Unfortunately, this is very much true.  All of the factors contributing to the adverse effects in our environment can be very much traced back to some technology that we developed over time to make our lives easier.  Other than making a return to living like in pre-historic times, an equilibrium needs to be reached where we continue to advance our quality of life while ensuring Earth can hold up.

### Business Task

In search of that equilibrium, this analysis will use public data from the World Bank Databank to determine any relation to some World Development Indicators against Environment issue indicators (e.g. CO2 emissions, GHG emissions, air pollution).  After going over through these indicators,  observations and insights may be acquired to be acted upon to save Earth while we live our lives better.

### Objectives

* Identify the top countries that provide international education and those that opt for studying abroad along with trends related to those.
* Identify if some specific factors/conditions of a given country relate to the number of international students they have.
* Predict the amount of international students for a given country given those factors.
